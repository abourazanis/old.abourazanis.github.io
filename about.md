  My name is <strong>Anastasios Bourazanis</strong>, and I am a full-stack web developer (currently using Python/Django) and mobile developer
  (mostly Android), with a passion for creating things that people want to use, and a drive for learning.
</p>
 <p>I currently work on <a href="http://www.giaola.gr">giaola.gr</a>, a small startup located in Athens, Greece. </p>
<p>
This blog is my thoughts and experiences on software development, or something like a public notebook.
</p>
Thanks for reading!
